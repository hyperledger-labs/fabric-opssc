## Basic Asset Transfer 

This sample implements the basic asset transfer scenario, illustrating the use of the Java Contract SDKs to provide a 
smart contract as a service.  

To run this chaincode contract locally on a development network, see: 

- [Debugging chaincode as a service](../../test-network-k8s/docs/CHAINCODE_AS_A_SERVICE.md) (Kube test network)
- [End-to-end with the test-network](../../test-network/CHAINCODE_AS_A_SERVICE_TUTORIAL.md#end-to-end-with-the-the-test-network) (Docker compose)
